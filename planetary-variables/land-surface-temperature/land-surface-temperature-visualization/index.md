## Evaluate and visualize

As Land Surface Temperature is commercial data, brought into Sentinel Hub as Bring Your Own Data, direct EO Browser and Sentinel Playground links are not possible due to the personalized data credentials.

## General description

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the thermodynamic temperature of Earthâ€™s surface. LST is a key variable controlling energy, and water fluxes over the land surface and atmosphere interface. In view of increasing extreme temperature events and a growing population exposed to these events, LST is increasingly relevant to sustainably manage food and water systems and urban living conditions.

Planet's LST product provides near real-time measurements twice a day at 1:30 and 13:30 solar local time and at spatial resolutions of 100 m and 1000 m. It is unhindered by clouds and has a long and consistent data record of more than 20 years. Please check [here](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/planet/land-surface-temp/#available-bands) for a list of available bands.

This script provides 4 outputs. The `default` output is for visualizing LST in EO Browser. The `index` output is the actual value of the LST. The `eobrowserStats` and `dataMask` outputs are configured to activate the statistical features in EO Browser.
