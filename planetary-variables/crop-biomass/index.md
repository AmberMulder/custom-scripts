# Crop Biomass

Biomass Proxy is a fusion of microwave and optical satellite imagery, using the advantages of each to accurately estimate relative above-ground crop biomass regardless of cloud cover and at a high spatial resolution (10 m x 10 m).

This is a relative measure of biomass, so each pixel value has a value of 0 (low biomass) to 1 (high biomass).
