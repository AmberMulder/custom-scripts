## Landsat 5 and 7 ESA Archive

Landsat 7 and the retired Landsat 5 orbit's are sun-synchronous, with near-polar orbits, flying at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi). Landsat 5 long outlived its original three-year design life. Developed by NASA and launched in 1984, Landsat 5 has orbited the planet over 150,000 times while transmitting over 2.5 million images land surface images around the world. The Landsat 7 satellite still orbits the the Earth in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit, at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi). The satellites are multispectra, providing visible, near infrared, mid infrared and thermal bands.
