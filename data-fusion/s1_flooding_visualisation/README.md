## General description of the script  
  
This script can be used to visualise flood events using Sentinel-1 GRD imagery. This is especially useful for areas of interest that are affected by cloud cover (common during flood events caused by excessive rainfall). The script uses a threshold of -15 decibels to classify flooded pixels. This value can be adjusted to suit your area of interest. In addition, to help the viewer orientate themselves, a clear Sentinel-2 image is used as the basemap for this visualisation so that it can be easily interpreted where the flood extent reaches for those unfamiliar with interpreting SAR images.
