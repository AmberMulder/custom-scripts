# Harmonized Landsat Sentinel

Harmonized Landsat Sentinel is a NASA initiative to produce a Virtual Constellation of surface reflectance (SR) data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Landsat 8-9 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, respectively. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2â€“3 days. Input products are Landsat 8-9 Collection 2 Level 1 top-of-atmosphere reflectance and Sentinel-2 L1C top-of-atmosphere reflectance, which NASA radiometrically harmonizes to the maximum extent, resamples to common 30-meter resolution, and grids using the Sentinel-2 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) UTM grid. Because of this, the products are different from Landsat 8-9 Collection 2 Level 2 surface reflectance and Sentinel-2 L2A surface reflectance. For more information about the available bands and data, check the [HLS documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/hls/#available-bands-and-data).
