# Airbus Pleiades (Commercial)

<a href="https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/en/8692-pleiades">Pléiades</a> constelation is composed of two twin satellites orbiting the Earth 180° apart. The satellites deliver the incredible global 0.5 m spectral resolution imagery. Pleiades' satellites share the orbit with SPOT satellites, which makes it possible to combine the data form both sources.
The Pléiades data with its high spatial resolution is suitable for a wide range of remote sensing applications such as vegetation monitoring, precise mapping, as well as risk and disaster management. To learn more about Pleiades, visit our <a href="https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/airbus/pleiades/"> documentation page.</a>

The spectral bands of Pleiades data are the following:

*B0 - Blue (430-550 nm,	resolution 2m)*

*B1 - Green (490-610 nm, resolution	2m)*

*B2 - Red (600-720 nm), resolution 2m*

*B3 - Near Infrared (750-950 nm), resolution 2m*

*PAN	- Panchromatic (480-830 nm), resolution 0.5m*

Pleiades's RGB bands are in 2 meter spatial resolution. To take advantage of the 0.5 m PAN band, the pansharpening process is required.
