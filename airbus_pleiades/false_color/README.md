## General description

The [False color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color) infrared composite maps near-infrared spectral band B3 with red and green bands, B2 and B1, to [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) components directly. It is most commonly used to assess plant density and healht, as plants reflect near infrared and green light, while absorbing red. Since they reflect more near infrared than green, plant-covered land appears deep red. Denser plant growth is darker red. Cities and exposed ground are gray or tan, and water appears blue or black.
