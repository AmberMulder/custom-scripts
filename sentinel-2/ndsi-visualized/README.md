## General description of the script

The Sentinel-2 normalised difference snow index can be used to differentiate between cloud and snow cover as snow absorbs in the short-wave infrared light, but reflects the visible light, whereas cloud is generally reflective in both wavelengths. Snow cover is represented in bright vivid blue.
